**# Project Summary**

Breaking Barriers is a Python + SQLite system designed to analyze accessibility gaps in after-school programs across San Antonio. Families face challenges finding programs due to scattered information, inconsistent quality, and limited availability.
This system centralizes all important information—program cost, ratings, availability, ZIP code demographics—and provides insightful queries to highlight where barriers exist.

The application features:

📊 A structured database with 4 connected tables

🖥 A Tkinter GUI for easy interaction

🛠 Full CRUD operations for all entities

🔍 Five analytical SQL queries

🧩 A clean architecture separating logic, GUI, and data

🏙 Real San Antonio ZIP code and program data
